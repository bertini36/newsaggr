**_NewsAggr - Elegant News Aggregator_**

## Features

- Clean and elegant UI design for optimal reading experience
- Real-time updates on trending news
- Google and GitHub OAuth login with data synchronization
- 30-minute default cache duration (logged-in users can force refresh)
- Adaptive scraping interval (minimum 2 minutes) based on source update frequency to optimize resource usage and prevent IP bans

## Deployment

### Basic Deployment

For deployments without login and caching:

1. Fork this repository
2. Import to platforms like Cloudflare Page or Vercel

### Cloudflare Page Configuration

- Build command: `pnpm run build`
- Output directory: `dist/output/public`

### GitHub OAuth Setup

1. [Create a GitHub App](https://github.com/settings/applications/new)
2. No special permissions required
3. Set callback URL to: `https://your-domain.com/api/oauth/github` (replace `your-domain` with your actual domain)
4. Obtain Client ID and Client Secret

### Environment Variables

Refer to `example.env.server`. For local development, rename it to `.env.server` and configure:

```env
# Github Client ID
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
# Github Client Secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
# JWT Secret, usually the same as Client Secret
JWT_SECRET=
# Google Client ID
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
# Google Client Secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
# Initialize database, must be set to true on first run, can be turned off afterward
INIT_TABLE=true
# Whether to enable cache
ENABLE_CACHE=true
```

### Database Support

Supported database connectors: https://db0.unjs.io/connectors
**Cloudflare D1 Database** is recommended.

1. Create D1 database in Cloudflare Worker dashboard
2. Configure database_id and database_name in wrangler.toml
3. If wrangler.toml doesn't exist, rename example.wrangler.toml and modify configurations
4. Changes will take effect on next deployment

### Docker Deployment

In project root directory:

```sh
docker compose up
```

You can also set Environment Variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

## Development
